# Ultimate-3D-Tic-Tac-Toe
Personal project linked to 3D Tic-Tac-Toe group project with Kieren Brookes from CS112 Amherst College, December, 2017. 

Creates the graphics of a 3D version of ultimate tic-tac-toe. Still in progress with the functions of the game.

Open to suggestions and ideas! Currently, looking into switching programming language to Python.
